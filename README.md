<!-- Env Variables -->
### :key: Environment Variables

In my guide on the chapter: "Environment variables".<br>
There is more about configuration env variables.
check it out here:
<br>
```` company_management_app_backend_nest/Guide/MyDevil Hosting Nest...pdf ````
<br>
If you want to run a project locally easiest way to do it:
use my secret file scheme and fill up all values according to your database


In this file, you will also find the Salt variable which is responsible for the hashPwd function.
Make sure is long and complicated enough

Also, there is a jwtConstants which also should be unique and complicated

```` src/secretFile.ts````
````
export const dbConnection = {
  DB_CONNECTION: 'mysql',
  DB_HOST: 'localhost',
  DB_USERNAME: 'Database User Name',
  DB_PASSWORD: 'Database User Password',
  DB_DATABASE: 'Database Name',
};

export const SALT = 'Salt for hash pwd';

export const jwtConstants = {
  secret: 'secret for jwt',
};

<h3>To run locally make sure backend is listening and database is implemented correctly. </h3>
<h3>You can check my quick video guide to see how to run the application on your localhost
</h3>

<h4>I'm working on the multi-user application, so the registry page on the frontend app is disabled.</h4>

After the project runs, please click the button "create default account"
<br>
you are able to use the account :

````
email: admin@gmail.com
password: admin
````

<h3>ATTENTION!
This is crucial to remove this endpoint when you deploy the app!
It is a temporary solution to an easy start with a project locally. </h3>
